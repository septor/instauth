# Instauth!

Get your Instagram `access_token` with this script. It's used for both my [Imggregator](https://github/septor/imggregator) e107 plugin and [Arcade](https://github.com/trickmod/arcade) my Photo Gallery script.

The source code is provided to hopefully show that I am not using any of the information obtained from the script!

## Notes!

You will need an Instagram application if you want to modify the `$client_id` and `$redirect_uri` variables to make it more custom. You can set one up by going to the [Instagram Developer](https://instagram.com/developer/) page and setting one up.

**Make sure** you set the `redirect_uri` on your application to the same URL you plan on putting this script! Errors **will** occur if you do not.
